・using PlayStation on FPGA feat. Pocket core.

1. Put the "Assets", "Cores" and "Platforms" in the dist on the SD card.

2. Put the PlayStation SCPH5500 BIOS file on the Assets/playstation/pgate1.PlayStation.
   The file name is "SCPH5500.bin". Other versions of BIOS have not been tested.

3. Put the .bin or .img created from the PlayStation-ROM with image creation software 
   (e.g. ImgBurn) in the Assets/playstation/pgate1.PlayStation.

4. OK. Insert the SD card into the Pocket, turn it on, and select PlayStation from openFPGA.

5. There are three choices from the file browser.

   If you choose ROM.bin(.img), the game will launch via the PS logo (if you are lucky).

   If you choose SCPH5500.bin, the PlayStation main menu will appear.

   If you choose a demo program such as PSXNICCC.exe, it will run without going through the PS logo.

6. Have fun until your Pocket's battery runs out.

If it works happily, please take a video of it and upload it to Twitter. I will be delighted.
Select button? to enter raw polygon drawing mode.


・What to do when it doesn't work

Immediately after the first black screen, red lines appear on all four sides.
  -> BIOS is not loaded properly. Check the file size and checksum.

Cannot proceed after PS logo is displayed.
  -> This software is not yet supported. Sorry.

During play, a red line appeared on all four sides and the game stopped.
  -> PlayStatoin Core has issued a HALT code. Insufficient functionality. Sorry.
